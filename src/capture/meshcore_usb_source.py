"""Capture source for MeshCore USB nodes.

Connects to a MeshCore companion radio via USB serial using the
``meshcore`` Python library, subscribes to incoming events, and
yields them as RawCapture objects for the pipeline.

Includes auto-reconnect with exponential backoff and a periodic
health check so the source self-heals after serial disconnects.

Events are JSON-serialised and decoded downstream by
``meshcore_event_adapter.adapt_event``.
